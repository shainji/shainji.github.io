This research recalaulated the missing data in water network based on graph sampling theory. The time series data are rearranged into graph and transformed into time Laplace matrix. Through analysis of characteristic frequency based on features of hydraulic data, the recalculating results demonstrates feasibility through data testing. <br>

Abstract
======
Data quality has always been a limiting factor for the development of water systems. <br>
This research carries out repair calculation for the missing data of water network based on graph signal sampling theory.
Graph signal sampling theory is a feature frequency analysis method based on graph theory, which arranges the time series data according to the adjacent correlation and periodicity of hydraulic data, so as to integrate the characteristics of hydraulic data. The graph data obtained by time series sorting is transformed into time Laplace matrix, and the characteristic frequency analysis and missing data estimation calculation are carried out by using the low frequency property of hydraulic data, so as to obtain hydraulic data of the whole time series.

The method shows feasibility on a considerable proportion of missing data. For discrete missing, when the missing proportion is within 30%, the R<sup>2</sup> of the results is more than 0.9, and the MSE is less than 0.1. For 3 consecutive days of missing data in 30 days, the R<sup>2</sup> is about 0.9 and the mean absolute error is about 20%. The method is also compared with other calculating methods such as linear calculation, periodic method and time-change pattern method.
