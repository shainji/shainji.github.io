Abstract
======
Inappropriate scheduling plans can not only lead to additional economic losses but also impact the safety of water supply. Optimizing traditional manual experience-based scheduling plans can help water utilities rationally allocate water plants and pump stations, ensuring the safety, stability, and economy of the water supply system. Although there are many studies on pump scheduling optimization, there is still a lack of a scheduling method that combines real-time, rationality, and optimization. To address this issue, we have innovatively proposed an intelligent scheduling framework based on deep learning. In this framework, two neural network models, Multi-Heads Convolutional Gated Recurrent
Unit Network(MH-CGRU) and Multi-Head Gated Recurrent Unit Network(MH-GRU), are designed to effectively extract key features from the operating status of the water distribution network(WDNs), predict the future decision variables of the WDNs, and generate scheduling orders for water plants and pump stations, respectively. The rationality of the orders is verified by combining a high-precision online hydraulic model and the evaluation of the operational status of the WDNs. This system has been deployed in a real WDN and put into practical application. From June to November of 2022, the total adoption rate of all orders reached 96.29%, with the average deviation between predicted and actual control targets being less than 5%, and energy consumption decreased by 3.05% compared to the previous year.
