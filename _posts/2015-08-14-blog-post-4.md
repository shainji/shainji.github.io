Abstract
======
Evaluating the value of scheduling decisions is a fundamental aspect of optimal operation of water distribution network. However, due to the relevance of scheduling decision sequences, accurately assessing the value of scheduling decisions has always been a challenge. This article proposed a calculation method to evaluate the value chain of scheduling. The scheduling process is  modeled as a Markov decision process by defining action space, state space, and immediate reward function. Considering the time-lasting effect of scheduling decisions, the method aims to gauge the cumulative value of these decisions. Based on the Bellman equation, the evaluation incorporates the specific state transition probability with expected value. The method is validated through practical data testing, demonstrating its rationality and efficacy.
